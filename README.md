# Kankan

This is a demo project for [Webfoundry](https://webfoundry.app/), the visual app and site builder.

It's a fully serverless P2P kanban board that uses Trystero (WebRTC) to connect users by link sharing.
Create a board and click the copy icon in the boards dropdown in the top-right corner to invite friends.
Anyone with the link has full read/write access to your board, so keep that in mind.

You can [try it live](https://kankan-demo.netlify.app/) or [import it into Webfoundry](https://www.webfoundry.app/editor.html?git=https://github.com/guiprav2/kanban.git) for editing, customization, or inspection.
It's a great way to learn about [Trystero](https://github.com/dmotz/trystero) and [Webfoundry](https://webfoundry.app/).
