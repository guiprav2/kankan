# Kankan Demo

This is a demo project for [https://webfoundry.app/](Webfoundry), the visual app and site builder.

It's a fully serverless P2P kanban board that uses Trystero (WebRTC) to connect users by link sharing.
Create a board and click the copy icon in the boards dropdown in the top-right corner to invite friends.
Anyone with the link has full read/write access to your board, so keep that in mind.

You can [https://kankan-demo.netlify.app/](try it live) or [https://www.webfoundry.app/editor.html?git=https://github.com/guiprav2/kanban.git](import it into Webfoundry) for editing, customization, or inspection.
It's a great way to learn about [https://github.com/dmotz/trystero](Trystero) and [https://webfoundry.app/](Webfoundry).
